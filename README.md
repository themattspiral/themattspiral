## Matt Ritter

I'm an engineering leader and full-stack developer.

I focus on writing software intelligently. I believe *describing* software is not the same thing as *building, extending, and maintaining* it.

Recently I've been working on open-source developer tooling for the WebAssembly ecosystem.

**Quick Stats**
- 14 years in software engineering & leadership
- Open source contributor: WebAssembly and test framework developer tooling
- Node/TypeScript/React primary stack, with broad generalist capabilities

**Approach**
- Understand how and why things work (or don't)
- Let engineering best practices shape software direction
- Ensure dev teams maintain intellectual ownership of the code they write - No autopilot

### Open-Source

**[vitest-pool-assemblyscript](https://github.com/themattspiral/vitest-pool-assemblyscript)** - An integration that brings native [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org) WASM testing capabilities to [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). I want to bring the excellent DX of Vitest to AssemblyScript testing, so that it is just as painless to adopt.

**[fast-prng-wasm](https://github.com/themattspiral/fast-prng-wasm)** - A suite of production-grade pseudo-random number generators for WebAssembly. Seamless to adopt with TypeScript in Node and all modern browsers - Zero WASM knowledge required.

Both projects use modern CI/CD, follow release best practices, see active usage through npm, and are designed for community contribution.

### Background

I've spent 14 years building software, most recently as a Solution Principal at Slalom Build where I wrote code, designed architecture, and led engineering delivery teams for Fortune 500 clients across industries. I've also enjoyed being a direct mentor, advocate, and people manager for eight developers.

My primary stack is Node and TypeScript, with React web frontends.

I've also shipped production systems in Java Spring, C#, Angular, and Vue, on AWS and GCP infrastructure, with deep experience in CI pipelines, enterprise integrations, and system architecture.

### Currently...

My recent open-source work has been deliberate. I've learned the most from communities that value building things correctly - where collaboration and shared ownership matter as much as the code itself - so I'd like to contribute back to that ecosystem.

I'm looking for engineering roles where I can build things and help teams work better, whether that's as a manager, IC, or somewhere in between. I'm particularly excited about developer tooling, platform teams, or anywhere WebAssembly is becoming real infrastructure.
