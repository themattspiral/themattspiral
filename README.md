## Matt Ritter

I'm an engineering leader and full-stack developer, focused on writing software intelligently in an age where it's tempting to think that describing software is just as easy as building, extending, and maintaining it.

I'm dedicated to understanding how and why things work (or don't), to letting engineering best practices shape software direction, and to ensuring development teams maintain intellectual ownership of the code they write in the age of AI coding - I don't run on autopilot!

I've spent time in many industries through small and large consulting firms, focused on sustainable software delivery and learning everything I can about what works and what doesn't. Recently I've been working on open-source developer tooling for the WebAssembly ecosystem.

### Open-Source

**[vitest-pool-assemblyscript](https://github.com/themattspiral/vitest-pool-assemblyscript)** - I'm building an integration that brings native [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org) WASM testing capabilities to [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). My aim for this project is to bring the same excellent DX users expect from Vitest to AssemblyScript testing, and make it just as painless to adopt.

**[fast-prng-wasm](https://github.com/themattspiral/fast-prng-wasm)** - A suite of production-grade pseudo-random number generators for WebAssembly. Seamless to adopt with TypeScript in Node and all modern browsers - zero WASM knowledge required.

Both projects use modern CI/CD, follow release best practices, see active usage through npm, and are designed for community contribution.

### Background

I've spent 14 years building software, most recently as a Solution Principal at Slalom Build where I wrote code, designed architecture, and led engineering delivery teams for Fortune 500 clients across industries. I've also enjoyed being a direct mentor, advocate, and people manager for eight developers.

My primary stack is Node and TypeScript, with React web frontends. I've also shipped production systems in Java Spring, C#, Angular, and Vue, on AWS and GCP infrastructure, with deep experience in CI pipelines, enterprise integrations, and system architecture.

### Currently...

My recent open-source work has been deliberate. I've learned the most from communities that value building things correctly - where collaboration and shared ownership matter as much as the code itself - so I'd like to contribute back to that ecosystem.

I'm looking for engineering roles where I can build things and help teams work better, whether that's as a manager, IC, or somewhere in between. I'm particularly excited about developer tooling, platform teams, or anywhere WebAssembly is becoming real infrastructure.
