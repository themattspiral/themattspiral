## Matt Ritter

I'm an engineering leader, full-stack developer, and builder. I focus on writing and delivering software intelligently.

I believe building, extending, and maintaining software well is a science, a discipline, and a craft - still work best suited to teams of people (even with AI assistance).

Recently I've been working on open-source developer tooling for the WebAssembly ecosystem.

### ⚡ Quick Stats
- 14 years in software engineering & leadership (including people management)
- Primary, go-deep stack is Node / TypeScript / React
- Broad tech generalist background (Java, C#, Angular, SQL, NoSQL, Cloud DevOps, sysadmin/IT)

### 🧠 My General Approach
- Support the people around me
- Understand how and why things work, or don't (both tech and process)
- Let engineering best practices guide architectural decisions
- Ensure teams maintain intellectual ownership of their output (no mental autopilot)

### 🌐 Open-Source

- **[vitest-pool-assemblyscript](https://github.com/themattspiral/vitest-pool-assemblyscript)** - Native [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org) WASM testing capabilities for [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Working to bring Vitest's excellent DX to AssemblyScript test tooling, and to help Vitest support a broader portion of the Node/web dev community's needs.
- **[fast-prng-wasm](https://github.com/themattspiral/fast-prng-wasm)** - Production-grade pseudo-random number generator suite for WebAssembly. Seamless to adopt with TypeScript in Node & all modern browsers - Zero WASM knowledge required.

Both projects use modern CI/CD, follow release best practices, see active usage through npm, and are designed for community contribution.

### ⌛ Currently...

My recent open-source work has been deliberate. I've learned the most from communities that value building things with pride - where collaboration and shared ownership matter as much as the code itself - so I'd like to contribute back to that ecosystem by creating something useful.

I'm looking for an engineering role where I can build things and help teams work better, whether that's as a manager, IC, or somewhere in between. I'm particularly excited about developer tooling, platform teams, or anywhere WebAssembly is becoming real infrastructure.

### 🤓 Background

I've spent 14 years building software, most recently as a Solution Principal at Slalom Build where I wrote code, designed web architecture, and led engineering delivery teams for Fortune 500 clients across industries.

Being a mentor and people manager has been one of the most satisfying parts of working as an engineering leader. I love teaching, talking through hard problems together, and giving perspective based on my experience.

My primary stack for deep knowledge is Node and TypeScript, often with React web frontends, focused on web architecture.

I'm a broadly capable tech generalist, having shipped production systems in Java Spring, C#, and Angular, with SQL and NoSQL DB stores, with Redis session caches, on AWS, GCP, and on-premises infrastructure. I have experience in production CI/CD pipeline setup, system architecture, and enterprise integrations.
